**[Project has no stable builds yet, please go on the alpha branch](https://github.com/NaomixNemo/nFX/tree/alpha#nfx)**

**Why is this project marked as a virus?**\
Honestly, I don't know nor is it a top priority. It's pretty upsetting but w/e, eventually I'm going to be pulling all plugs from node.js so literally every bit of code this project uses will be visible and documented.

**I found this project by random, should I use it?**\
Gonna be real with you, no.\
I'd absolutely __love__ alpha testers and such but using it in your code as it is right now is not recommended.\
Almost every update for a long while will break the code.
